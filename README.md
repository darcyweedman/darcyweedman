## A bit about me.

I'm a maths and computer science student with a keen interest in machine learning and statistics.

### Work History.

- **Australian Bureau of Statistics**: Improved the census data process, making it faster and more accurate. Currently here as an undergrad engineer
- **Geoimage**: Played around with YOLOv8 for object classification in geospatial imagery. Also, automated some stuff.
- **UQ Financial Technology Society**: I got to organise some cool events and meet even cooler people
- **SIG Discovery Day**: Spent a couple days pretending I understood high-frequency trading. 
- **More Geoimage**: Used graph theory to automate mapping and played with some big data, making life easier for everyone involved.

### Tech & Tools.

I've dabbled in a bit of everything from Java to Python, SQL, and even Visual Basic when I'm feeling nostalgic. Current side projects are playing around with FastAPI, google cloud, and Typescript
