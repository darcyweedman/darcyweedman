# Hey there, I'm Darcy Weedman! 👋

🌏 Based in Brisbane, Australia | 🎓 Studying Maths & Comp Sci @ University of Queensland (Class of 2025)

## A little bit about me...

I'm a maths and computer science student with a keen interest in machine learning and statistics, currently navigating through my dual degree at UQ.

### 🚀 Professional Adventures

- **Australian Bureau of Statistics**: Improved the census data process, making it faster and more accurate. Currently here as an undergrad engineer
- **Geoimage**: Played around with YOLOv8 for object classification in geospatial imagery. Also, automated some stuff.
- **UQ Financial Technology Society**: I got to organize some cool events and meet even cooler people
- **SIG Discovery Day**: Spent a couple days pretending I understood high-frequency trading. 
- **More Geoimage**: Used graph theory to automate mapping and played with some big data, making life easier for everyone involved.

### 💻 Tech & Tools

I've dabbled in a bit of everything from Java to Python, SQL, and even Visual Basic when I'm feeling nostalgic. AWS has been my playground recently.
